Usage:

You may find it useful to place the needed shortcuts in the Windows task bar, so that you have easy access and don't need to interrupt your current work.
Furthermore you can also specify a hotkey in the properties of the shortcuts to launch the functions, e.g. F7 -> activate headset and F8 -> deactivate headset.

For uninstalling please use the uninstaller in the Start Menu or use the integrated program manager from windows.
